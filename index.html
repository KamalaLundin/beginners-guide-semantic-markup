                <h2>What is semantic markup?</h2>
                <p>
                    Semantic markup is a way of writing HTML that makes it easier to read and understand by humans, assistive technology and search engines. Semantic HTML elements (tags) provide meaning (semantics) to their content. They help us interpret what role the content has and how important it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the early days of the internet, HTML markup was merely used to display scientific documents containing hyperlinks to other documents. As the web grew popular and spread more widely, HTML evolved as well. The need to make the webpages look better grew too, and developers needed easier ways to create more complex layouts. They started to structure their pages through generic elements such as &lt;div&gt;, which allowed them to group content together for styling purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although a &lt;div&gt; element works fine as a general container for content, it doesn't say anything about the type of content. For <a href="#why">reasons explained below</a>, developers needed elements that described what kind of content the markup displayed. This is where semantic markup comes into play. The latest HTML version - HTML5 - includes many useful semantic elements that provide meaning to the content. <a href="#elements"> Check out a few of the most important elements here</a>.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="why">
                <h2>Why is semantic markup important?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several good reasons as to why semantic markup is important. Here are the top three:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accessibility:</strong> For sighted users, the layout of a webpage often provides the visual structure needed to identify the different parts of the page. Sighted users can skim through the page and choose what content is relevant for them. Users who are visually impaired or blind should have the same possibility. These users rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers to navigate the page and interact with it's content. Semantic markup helps the technology interpret and communicate the content more accurately, which gives the user a much better experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Search Engine Optimization:</strong> When it comes to Search Engine Optimization (SEO), webpages displayed through semantic HTML markup will rank higher in search results compared to pages using more generic markup. This is because search engines (just like assistive technologies) rely on semantic markup when interpreting the content and context of a page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Maintenance:</strong> Semantic elements make the HTML markup itself easier to manage. Semantic markup helps the developers to read and understand their own code. When reviewing or editing someone else's code, the consistency provided by the semantics makes the collaboration smoother. If the purpose of each section can be quickly identified, it also becomes easier to update the code. When working with the HTML markup through other languages such as CSS or JavaScript, it is easier to get an idea of the content without having to look too closely in the markup.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <tbody>
                        <tr>

                                <h3>&lt;title&gt;</h3>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                The title element is telling us the title of the webpage. The content between the tags is shown in the browser's title bar or tab and will be the default bookmark name if a user adds the page to their favorites. The title will also be shown as the title for a page in a search engine result.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                The title element should go in the &lt;head&gt; element in the HTML. It doesn't go in the &lt;body&gt; of the document.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>

                                <h3>&lt;header&gt;</h3>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                The &lt;header&gt; element is a container for introductory content such as logo, company name, search feature, headings and navigation links. It usually works as a banner for the page, re-used globally across the website. However, it can also be used within an &lt;article&gt; or a &lt;section&gt; to represent the introduction to that particular piece of content.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                The &lt;header&gt; usually goes in the top of the page, unless it is nested within an &lt;article&gt; or a &lt;section&gt; - in which case it goes in the top of that particular element.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <h3>&lt;nav&gt;</h3>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                The &lt;nav&gt; element is a container for a block of navigation links, for example a menu. It is often nested inside other element such as the &lt;header&gt;. The navigation links can lead to other sections of the same page, to other pages on the same site or to other websites.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                Not all links must be placed within in a &lt;nav&gt; element!
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <h3>&lt;main&gt;</h3>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                The &lt;main&gt; element contains the primary content of that particular page. The content should be directly related to the topic of that particular page. The content of the &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;, for example, is often more generic and will not be included in the main element.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                There shouldn’t be more than one &lt;main&gt; element in one page! So unlike the &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; element, we don’t have the option to nest it within an &lt;article&gt; or a &lt;section&gt;.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <h3>&lt;aside&gt;</h3>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                The &lt;aside&gt; element is used for content that is secondary to the main content of the page. The content is typically separate, but indirectly related to the main content. Examples include additional information, advertisement and navigations.                            </td>
                            <td>The &lt;aside&gt; element is often used for sidebars!</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <h3>&lt;footer&gt;</h3>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                The &lt;footer&gt; element holds content that improves the site's usability. It goes at the very bottom of the page and is typically re-used globally across the site. From here the user can usually navigate the site through a site-map, and easily reach things like contact information, social media links, privacy policies, copyright data and information about the author.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                Similarly to the &lt;header&gt; element, a &lt;footer&gt; element can also be nested within an &lt;article&gt; or a &lt;section&gt;! The primary &lt;footer&gt; always goes at the bottom of the page though.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <h3>&lt;article&gt;</h3>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                The &lt;article&gt; element is used for content that can stand on it's own - for example a blog post, a newspaper article, a product review or a comment.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                &lt;article&gt; elements can be nested in &lt;section&gt; elements, and &lt;section&gt; elements can be nested in &lt;article&gt; elements!
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <h3>&lt;section&gt;</h3>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                The &lt;section&gt; element is used to divide content into logical sub-sections. A &lt;section&gt; element typically groups related content together. An &lt;article&gt; element, for example, could include a few &lt;section&gt; elements, or a &lt;main&gt; element of a page could be divided into a few different &lt;section&gt; elements.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                &lt;article&gt; elements can be nested in &lt;section&gt; elements, and &lt;section&gt; elements can be nested in &lt;article&gt; elements!

                    Hi, my name is Kamala.&#128075; I am an aspiring front-end developer and the author of this site. I have created it as a way of learning about semantics myself, since I find it an important topic. Hopefully others can benefit from my learnings as well. So far, the guide is best viewed in a desktop, but a responsive version is under development... If you have any feedback or suggestions for the site, or if you simply want to get in touch, I would love to hear from you!
