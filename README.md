# The beginner's guide to semantic markup
Hi, my name is Kamala.&#128075;

I am an aspiring front-end developer and the author of this guide to semantic HTML markup. I have created it as a way of learning about semantics myself, since I find it an important topic. Hopefully others can benefit from my learnings as well. So far, the guide is best viewed in a desktop, but a responsive version is under development...

If you have any feedback or suggestions for the site, or if you simply want to get in touch, I would love to hear from you!
